    <h1>Overview</h1>

        <h3>Looking back...</h3>
        <p>
        In the past, France has already tried taking Vimy Ridge. It was a high priority target yet, despite this, all previous attempts were unsuccessful. Over 100,000 French troops attempted to take the ridge and lost to the Germans only numbering 15,000. 
        </p>

        <h3>3 years after the beginning of WW1...</h3>
        <p>
        The Canadian Corps would fight against the German forces. At this point, soldiers were running out of resources and the war was needing to end. For Canadians, the goal was to take Vimy Ridge away from the Germans. Unlike previous battles, there was a lot of preparation involved. Specific roles for the battle were assigned and were trained specifically for the terrain.
        </p>

        <h3>The battle begins on April 9, 1917 at 5:30 AM...</h3>
        <p>
        All four of the Canadian divisions attacked the German held ridge. Led by General Arthur Currie, tunnellers, engineers, and railway troops all worked together. Canadian troops would successfully storm the ridge despite facing significant opposition and heavily fortified German positions. Creeping barrage was used and helped Canada tremendously. The battle lasted for a total of 3 days and the Canadians achieved victory on April 12. <br><br> 

        <i>Data: 15,000 casualties for a territory that was 9 km long and 8 km wide.</i>
