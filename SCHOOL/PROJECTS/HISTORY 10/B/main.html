    <h1>
        How was it defining?
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Person’s Case was a defining moment for Canada as it was a direct advancement of women’s rights. The Person’s Case challenged the idea that women were not considered as “persons” in a legal sense. The decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council recognized women as persons under the law,  marking a significant step forward for women’s rights. It broadened the understanding of legal terms and highlighted the need for equality in the country’s constitutional framework. 
    </p>


    <h1>
        Relevance
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Person’s Case is still relevant today as public perception was forever changed along with a greater equality achieved. The appearance and actions of the Famous Five motivate participation of women in public and political life to increase. The activism of the Famous Five serves as a milestone in Canada’s progress towards equal rights and opportunities for women. It provides a foundation for arguments in favour of gender equality and helps guide future legal challenges related to women’s rights.
