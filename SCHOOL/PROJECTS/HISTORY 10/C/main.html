    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <p>
        The Dust Bowl was the drought of the 1930s. It was one of the worst droughts to be ever recorded. It not only affected agricultural aspects of life, but it also caused horrific dustorms. <br><br>

        Mainly the Prairie Provinces in Canada were affected along with parts of the United States. <br><br>

        <b>How did it start?</b> <br><br>

        To summarise, the Dust Bowl was primarily caused by a combination of prolonged drought, poor farming practices, and economic depression. <br><br>

        1. In the 1920s, crops were cheap and machinery was expensive. This causes farmers to slowly abandon taking care of their crops, soil, and land. The quality of soil severely worsens due to wind erosion and destruction of topsoil. <br> <br>

        2. In 1929, The Great Depression also contributes to this drought due to the general fall of economy. <br> <br>

        3. In 1930, the “Dust Bowl” officially begins. <br><br> <br> 

        Schools were cancelled and citizens were forced to move out of their homes in hope of finding better places for life and work. Everything around looked completely lifeless and was causing a huge mental burden on the people living at the time.

        How was it defining?
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Dust Bowl was a wake-up call for Canadian farmers and policymakers. It highlighted the importance of sustainable agriculture and proper land management. The Dust Bowl caused there to be changes in farming techniques as well as the adoption of soil conservation practices to prevent soil erosion and preserve fertility. This moment in history also caused population shifts around the country due to people having to move out of their homes.

        Because of this drought, the federal and provincial government agencies develop the “Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration” to help farmers in situations like these where finances are tough. Also, the Dust Bowl continues to serve as a lesson to the importance of proper farming  practices. It showed the severe consequences of degradation.
