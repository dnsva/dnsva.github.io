    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        On June 6, 1944, D-Day marked the Allied invasion of Normandy, France during World War II. It was a pivotal event and the largest amphibious assault in history, involving forces from the United States, Britain, Canada, and other Allied nations. D-Day marked the beginning of the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi Germany's control. 
        <br><br>
        To capture Normandy, each division had to capture a specific part of the beach. The Canadians had to capture Juno beach (one of five assault beaches). The point of D-Day was to keep pressure and take advantage of the Axis division of forces. On June 6, 1944, over 10,000 Canadian sailors in 110 warships, 15 RCAF squadrons, and 14,000 soldiers took part in D-Day.
        <br><br>
        The operation involved extensive planning and coordination, including amphibious landings, airborne operations and naval support.
        <br><br>
        At first a lot of artillery was dropped, targeting railway centres, train rails, bridges, airfields, radar stations, and military bases.
        <br><br>
        The invasion itself occured in five phases:
        <br><br>
        <b>Phase 1:</b> 12:00AM, involves 23,400 Allied paratroopers dropping in behind Normandy to prevent Germans from retreating from the beaches.
        <br><br>
        <b>Phase 2:</b> 1:00AM, the balloon army “mobilises”, tricking the Germans into preparing for an attack there. The balloons, known as barrage balloons, were used to make the Axis think that we had a real army coming from there. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Phase 3:</b> Aerial attacks destroy German defences at Normandy.
        <br><br>
        <b>Phase 4:</b> 5:00AM, naval ships bombard German defences around the landing area
        <br><br>
        <b>Phase 5:</b> 6:00AM, assault boats are launched and 156,000 troops land on the beaches
        <br><br>
        From a numbers and objective point of view, the Allies took the victory. This battle was largely about overwhelming the enemy with numbers.

        How was it defining?
    </h1>
    <p>
        The success of Canadian forces on Juno Beach was significant as they faced heavily fortified German positions and overcame strong resistance. Canada contributed to the third-largest Allied contingent, with over 14,000 Canadian soldiers taking part in the invasion. The battle displayed courage and determination of the Canadian troops which further helped to solidify their reputation as skilled soldiers.

        The Battle of Normandy remains an integral part of Canadian military history and identity. The sacrifices made by Canadian soldiers during the battle are remembered and honoured through memorials and commemorative events. D-Day serves as a reminder of the importance of international cooperation, as it was a joint effort by Allied forces to liberate Europe from Nazi occupation.
