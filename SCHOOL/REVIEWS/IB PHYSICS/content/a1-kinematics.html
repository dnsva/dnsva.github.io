<h1>A.1 Kinematics</h1>

<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
<p><span class="vocabulary" data-definition="The branch of physics dealing with the motion of objects without reference to the forces causing the motion">Kinematics</span> is the study of motion. It involves several key quantities:</p>

<p>• <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Change in position relative to a reference point. Can be positive or negative depending on direction.">Displacement</span> (Δx): The change in position of an object</p>

<p>• <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="The rate of change of position with respect to time. A vector quantity that includes both speed and direction.">Velocity</span> (v): The rate of change of displacement</p>

<p>• <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="The rate of change of velocity with time. Indicates how quickly an object's velocity is changing.">Acceleration</span> (a): The rate of change of velocity</p>

<h2>Key Equations</h2>
<div class="formula">
    <p>Average velocity: $v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$</p>
    <p>Instantaneous velocity: $v = \frac{dx}{dt}$</p>
    <p>Acceleration: $a = \frac{dv}{dt}$</p>

<h3>Graph Relationships</h3>
<p>The <span class="vocabulary">gradient</span> of a position-time graph gives velocity, while the gradient of a velocity-time graph gives acceleration.</p>
