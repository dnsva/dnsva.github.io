<h1>B.1 Thermal Energy Transfers</h1>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<p>
    <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="The average kinetic energy of particles in a substance">Temperature</span> 
    and <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="The total internal energy of a system, including both kinetic and potential energy of particles">thermal energy</span> 
    are related but distinct concepts in thermodynamics.
</p>

<h2>Methods of Heat Transfer</h2>
<p>Heat can be transferred through three main mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Transfer of heat through direct contact between particles. Occurs in solids, liquids, and gases">Conduction</span>: 
        Direct transfer through matter</li>
    <li><span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Transfer of heat through the movement of fluid (liquid or gas) particles">Convection</span>: 
        Transfer through fluid movement</li>
    <li><span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves, requiring no medium">Radiation</span>: 
        Transfer through electromagnetic waves</li>
</ul>

<h2>Black-Body Radiation</h2>
<p>A <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="A perfect absorber and emitter of electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths">black body</span> is an idealized object that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Absorbs all incident radiation</li>
    <li>Is a perfect emitter of radiation</li>
    <li>Emits radiation with a characteristic spectrum that depends only on temperature</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stefan-Boltzmann Law</h2>
<div class="formula">
    <p>The total power radiated by a black body is given by:</p>
    $$P = \sigma AT^4$$
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p>$P$ = power radiated (W)</p>
    <p>$\sigma$ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant ($5.67 × 10^{-8}$ W/m²·K⁴)</p>
    <p>$A$ = surface area (m²)</p>
    <p>$T$ = absolute temperature (K)</p>
</div>

<h2>Wien's Displacement Law</h2>
<div class="formula">
    <p>The wavelength of maximum intensity is given by:</p>
    $$\lambda_{max}T = b$$
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p>$\lambda_{max}$ = peak wavelength (m)</p>
    <p>$T$ = absolute temperature (K)</p>
    <p>$b$ = Wien's displacement constant ($2.9 × 10^{-3}$ m·K)</p>
</div>

<h2>Intensity and Distance</h2>
<div class="formula">
    <p>The intensity of radiation follows an inverse square law:</p>
    $$I = \frac{P}{4\pi d^2}$$
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p>$I$ = intensity (W/m²)</p>
    <p>$P$ = power radiated (W)</p>
    <p>$d$ = distance from source (m)</p>
</div>
