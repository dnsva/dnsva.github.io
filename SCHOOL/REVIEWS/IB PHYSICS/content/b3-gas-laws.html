<h1>B.3 Gas Laws</h1>

<h2>Pressure in Matter</h2>
<p>
    <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Force per unit area acting perpendicular to a surface">Pressure</span> ($P = \frac{F}{A}$, where $F$ is the perpendicular force and $A$ is the area)
    can be measured in several units:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pascal (Pa)</strong>: SI unit, $1\text{ Pa} = 1\text{ N/m}^2$</li>
        <li><strong>Atmosphere (atm)</strong>: Average sea-level pressure</li>
        <li><strong>Millimeters of mercury (mmHg)</strong>: Based on mercury barometer height</li>
        <li><strong>Bar</strong>: Approximately atmospheric pressure</li>
        <li><strong>Pounds per square inch (psi)</strong>: Common in US/UK engineering</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Common conversions:</strong>
    $$1\text{ kPa} = 9.869 \times 10^{-3}\text{ atm} = 7.501\text{ mmHg} = 0.01\text{ bar} = 0.145\text{ psi}$$
</p>

<h3>Pressure in Different States of Matter (pg 253)</h3>

<h4>1. Solids</h4>
<p>The weight W of a solid acts vertically downwards onto a horizontal surface on which it rests. The contact area of the solid on the surface is A.</p>
<div class="formula">
    $$P = \frac{W}{A}$$
    <p>Units: $W$ in newtons (N) represents downward weight force, $A$ in square meters (m²) is contact area</p>
</div>

<h4>2. Liquids</h4>
<p>The pressure $P$ in a liquid at a depth $h$ depends on the gravitational field strength $g$ and the liquid density $\rho$. The pressure definition leads to:</p>
<div class="formula">
    $$P = \rho gh$$
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p>$\rho$ = density of liquid (kg/m³)</p>
    <p>$g$ = gravitational field strength (N/kg)</p>
    <p>$h$ = depth (m)</p>
</div>

<h4>3. Gases</h4>
<p>
    The pressure is caused by the force exerted by the gas molecules on the wall of the gas container when they transfer momentum as they rebound at the wall. The pressure of the gas depends on other quantities such as the number of gas particles in the container, the volume of the container and the absolute temperature (in K) of the gas.

    <p><strong>Worked Example 2:</strong></p>
    <p>The quietest sound a young person with normal hearing can hear corresponds to an air-pressure variation of about 2 × 10⁻⁵ Pa. The diameter of the human eardrum is about 9 mm. Estimate the amplitude of the force exerted on the eardrum by the quietest detectable sound.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p>The surface area of the eardrum is π(9 × 10⁻³/2)² = 6 × 10⁻⁵ m².</p>
    <p>The variation of the force is of the order of:</p>
    <p>P × A = 2 × 10⁻⁵ × 6 × 10⁻⁵ ≃ 10⁻⁹ N</p>
    <p>Such a small force is sufficient to produce a vibration of the eardrum that the human ear can detect!</p>
</div>

<h2>Avogadro's Number and the Mole</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="The SI unit for amount of substance, equal to 6.02214076 × 10²³ particles">mole</span> (mol) is the SI unit for measuring the amount of a substance. It is defined as exactly 6.02214076 × 10²³ particles.
</p>

<p>
    This number is known as <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="The number of particles in one mole of a substance (6.02214076 × 10²³)">Avogadro's number</span> ($N_A$). Just as a dozen represents 12 items, a mole represents $N_A$ particles.
</p>

<div class="formula">
    $$N_A = 6.02214076 \times 10^{23} \text{ particles/mol}$$
</div>

<div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>For 0.5 mol of water (H₂O):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Number of H₂O molecules = 0.5 × 6.02214076 × 10²³</li>
        <li>Number of H atoms = 2 × (0.5 × 6.02214076 × 10²³)</li>
        <li>Number of O atoms = 0.5 × 6.02214076 × 10²³</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Total atoms ≈ 10²⁴ atoms per half mole of water</p>
</div>

<h2>Molar Mass</h2>
<p>
    The use of the <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="6.02214076 × 10²³ particles">mole</span> to yield numbers of atoms and molecules leads to molar mass. Nitrogen gas normally has two atoms and is written as N₂. One mole of nitrogen has 12.044 × 10²³ atoms. The mass of one mole of nitrogen atoms is 14.01 g and so the mass of one mole of nitrogen molecules must be 28.02 g.

<h3>Ideal Gas Law</h3>
