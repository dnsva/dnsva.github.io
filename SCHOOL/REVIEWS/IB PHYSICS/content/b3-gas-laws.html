<h1>B.3 Gas Laws</h1>

<h2>Pressure in Matter</h2>
<p>
    <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Force per unit area acting perpendicular to a surface">Pressure</span> ($P = \frac{F}{A}$, where $F$ is the perpendicular force and $A$ is the area)
    can be measured in several units:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pascal (Pa)</strong>: SI unit, $1\text{ Pa} = 1\text{ N/m}^2$</li>
        <li><strong>Atmosphere (atm)</strong>: Average sea-level pressure</li>
        <li><strong>Millimeters of mercury (mmHg)</strong>: Based on mercury barometer height</li>
        <li><strong>Bar</strong>: Approximately atmospheric pressure</li>
        <li><strong>Pounds per square inch (psi)</strong>: Common in US/UK engineering</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Common conversions:</strong>
    $$1\text{ kPa} = 9.869 \times 10^{-3}\text{ atm} = 7.501\text{ mmHg} = 0.01\text{ bar} = 0.145\text{ psi}$$
</p>

<h3>Pressure in Different States of Matter (pg 253)</h3>

<h4>1. Solids</h4>
<p>The weight W of a solid acts vertically downwards onto a horizontal surface on which it rests. The contact area of the solid on the surface is A.</p>
<div class="formula">
    $$P = \frac{W}{A}$$
    <p>Units: $W$ in newtons (N) represents downward weight force, $A$ in square meters (m²) is contact area</p>
</div>

<h4>2. Liquids</h4>
<p>The pressure $P$ in a liquid at a depth $h$ depends on the gravitational field strength $g$ and the liquid density $\rho$. The pressure definition leads to:</p>
<div class="formula">
    $$P = \rho gh$$
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p>$\rho$ = density of liquid (kg/m³)</p>
    <p>$g$ = gravitational field strength (N/kg)</p>
    <p>$h$ = depth (m)</p>
</div>

<h4>3. Gases</h4>
<p>
    The pressure is caused by the force exerted by the gas molecules on the wall of the gas container when they transfer momentum as they rebound at the wall. The pressure of the gas depends on other quantities such as the number of gas particles in the container, the volume of the container and the absolute temperature (in K) of the gas.

<div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Worked Example 2:</strong></p>
    <p>The quietest sound a young person with normal hearing can hear corresponds to an air-pressure variation of about 2 × 10⁻⁵ Pa. The diameter of the human eardrum is about 9 mm. Estimate the amplitude of the force exerted on the eardrum by the quietest detectable sound.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p>The surface area of the eardrum is π(9 × 10⁻³/2)² = 6 × 10⁻⁵ m².</p>
    <p>The variation of the force is of the order of:</p>
    <p>P × A = 2 × 10⁻⁵ × 6 × 10⁻⁵ ≃ 10⁻⁹ N</p>
    <p>Such a small force is sufficient to produce a vibration of the eardrum that the human ear can detect!</p>
</div>

<h2>Avogadro's Number and the Mole</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="The SI unit for amount of substance, equal to 6.02214076 × 10²³ particles">mole</span> (mol) is the SI unit for measuring the amount of a substance. It is defined as exactly 6.02214076 × 10²³ particles.
</p>

<p>
    This number is known as <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="The number of particles in one mole of a substance (6.02214076 × 10²³)">Avogadro's number</span> ($N_A$). Just as a dozen represents 12 items, a mole represents $N_A$ particles.
</p>

<div class="formula">
    $$N_A = 6.02214076 \times 10^{23} \text{ particles/mol}$$
</div>

<div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>For 0.5 mol of water (H₂O):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Number of H₂O molecules = 0.5 × 6.02214076 × 10²³</li>
        <li>Number of H atoms = 2 × (0.5 × 6.02214076 × 10²³)</li>
        <li>Number of O atoms = 0.5 × 6.02214076 × 10²³</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Total atoms ≈ 10²⁴ atoms per half mole of water</p>
</div>

<h2>Molar Mass</h2>
<p>
    The use of the <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="6.02214076 × 10²³ particles">mole</span> to yield numbers of atoms and molecules leads to molar mass. Nitrogen gas normally has two atoms and is written as N₂. One mole of nitrogen has 12.044 × 10²³ atoms. The mass of one mole of nitrogen atoms is 14.01 g and so the mass of one mole of nitrogen molecules must be 28.02 g.
</p>


<h2>Gas Laws</h2>
<h3>Boyle's Law</h3>
<p>The pressure P of a fixed quantity of gas (that is, a constant number of molecules) is inversely proportional to its volume V when the temperature does not change.</p>
<div class="formula">
    <p>The law can be written algebraically in two ways:</p>
    <p>$$P \propto \frac{1}{V} \text{ or } PV = \text{constant} \text{ (}\text{when temperature is constant)}$$</p>
</div>

<h3>Charles's Law</h3>
<p>At constant pressure:</p>
<div class="formula">
    $$V \propto T$$
    $$\frac{V}{T} = \text{constant}$$
    <p>Volume is directly proportional to absolute temperature</p>
</div>


<h3>Gay-Lussac's Law</h3>
<p>The pressure of a fixed quantity of gas at a constant volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature</p>
<div class="formula">
    $$P \propto T$$
    $$\frac{P}{T} = \text{constant (at constant volume)}$$
</div>


<h3>Avogadro's Law</h3>
<p>
    <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="At constant temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gases contain equal numbers of particles">Avogadro's law</span> states that at constant temperature and pressure, the quantity of gas (in moles) is directly proportional to its volume:
</p>

<div class="formula">
    $$n \propto V$$ 
    $$\frac{n}{V} = \text{constant}$$ 
    <p>(at constant temperature and pressure)</p>
</div>

<h3>Ideal Gas Law</h3>
<p>
    Combining Boyle's, Charles's, Gay-Lussac's, and Avogadro's laws yields the <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Equation describing the relationship between pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of an ideal gas">ideal gas equation</span> (or equation of state):
</p>

<div class="formula">
    $$PV = nRT$$
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p>$P$ = pressure (Pa)</p>
    <p>$V$ = volume (m³)</p>
    <p>$n$ = number of moles</p>
    <p>$R$ = gas constant (8.31 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹)</p>
    <p>$T$ = temperature (K)</p>
</div>
<h3>Physical Interpretation of R</h3>
<p>The gas constant R can be interpreted as a type of specific heat capacity per mole, similar to how specific heat capacity c represents energy per unit mass per kelvin:</p>

<div class="formula">
    <p>Units of R: J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹</p>
    <p>Units of c: J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹</p>
</div>

<p>This interpretation helps explain why PV = nRT represents energy:</p>
<div class="formula">
    <p>PV has units of energy (Pa × m³ = N/m² × m³ = N·m = J)</p>
    <p>nRT also has units of energy (mol × J/mol·K × K = J)</p>
</div>


<h4>Alternative Form</h4>
<p>
    Since one mole contains $N_A$ molecules (Avogadro's number), we can rewrite the ideal gas law in terms of the total number of molecules $N$ by defining the <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Constant relating energy at molecular level, equal to R/Nₐ">Boltzmann constant</span> $k_B = \frac{R}{N_A}$:
</p>

<div class="formula">
    $$\frac{PV}{NT} = k_B$$
    $$PV = Nk_BT$$
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p>$N$ = total number of molecules</p>
    <p>$k_B = \frac{R}{N_A} = \frac{8.31}{6.02 \times 10^{23}} = 1.38 \times 10^{-23}$ J/K</p>
</div>

<h3>Formula Summary</h3>
<div class="formula">
    <p>Key equations from above:</p>
    $$P = \frac{F}{A}$$
    $$n = \frac{N}{N_A}$$
    <p style="color: var(--highlight);">$$\frac{PV}{T} = \text{constant}$$</p>
    <p style="color: var(--highlight);">$$PV = nRT = Nk_BT$$</p>

<h2>Kinetic Model of an Ideal Gas</h2>
<p>
    The gas laws discussed above were developed through 150 years of <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Based on observation and experiment rather than theory">empirical</span> experimentation. However, we can also develop a <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="A simplified representation of a physical system used to explain and predict behavior">theoretical model</span> based on mechanical principles to describe ideal gas behavior and compare how these approaches complement each other.
</p>

<p>
    The ideal gas model we develop is known as the <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="A theoretical model describing gas behavior based on molecular motion">kinetic model of an ideal gas</span> and it is based on a set of assumptions:
</p>

<div class="formula">
    <p><strong>Key Assumptions of the Kinetic Theory:</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <span style="color: var(--highlight)">1</span>. The gas is made up of tiny particles (molecules or atoms) that are all identical and have the same mass.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <span style="color: var(--highlight)">2</span>. These particles are in constant random motion.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <span style="color: var(--highlight)">3</span>. The total volume of the particles is negligible compared with the total volume of the gas. (This is the same as saying that the average distance between particles is much greater than their average size.)
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <span style="color: var(--highlight)">4</span>. The particles collide <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Collisions where kinetic energy is conserved">elastically</span> with each other and with the walls of their container.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <span style="color: var(--highlight)">5</span>. Intermolecular forces between the particles and the walls can be ignored except during collisions. (This means that the energy in the gas can be considered as entirely kinetic with no potential-energy contribution.)
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <span style="color: var(--highlight)">6</span>. Collisions happen very quickly - the time for a collision between particles, and the time for a collision between a particle and the wall are negligible compared with the time between collisions.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <span style="color: var(--highlight)">7</span>. External forces (such as gravity) are ignored.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    When analyzing the motion of gas particles in the kinetic model, we consider that each particle moves with a velocity $v$ which can be resolved into three perpendicular components $v_x$, $v_y$, and $v_z$.
</p>
<div class="formula">
    <p><strong>Force on Container Walls:</strong></p>
    $$F_x = \frac{mv_x^2}{L}$$
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p>$F_x$ = force exerted by particle on right/left wall</p>
    <p>$m$ = mass of one particle</p>
    <p>$L$ = length of container</p>
    <p>$v_x$ = velocity component in x direction</p>

    <p>Average force:</p>
    $$\overline{F_x} = \frac{Nm}{L}\overline{v_x^2}$$
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p>$N$ = number of particles</p>
    <p>$\overline{v_x^2}$ = mean of square velocities</p>

    <p><strong>Mean Square Speed of Molecules:</strong></p>
    $$\overline{v^2} = \overline{v_x^2} + \overline{v_y^2} + \overline{v_z^2}$$

    <p><strong>Total Force on Wall:</strong></p>
    $$F = \frac{1}{3}\frac{Nm}{L}\overline{v^2}$$

    <p>For large $N$, the gas particles move with equal probability in all directions, meaning:</p>
    $$\overline{v_x^2} = \overline{v_y^2} = \overline{v_z^2}$$
    $$\therefore \overline{v^2} = 3\overline{v_x^2} \text{ or } \overline{v_x^2} = \frac{1}{3}\overline{v^2}$$

    <p><strong>Pressure on Wall:</strong></p>
    $$P = \frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Area}} = \frac{F}{A}$$
    $$A = L^2$$
    $$P = \frac{1}{3}\frac{Nm}{L} \cdot \frac{1}{L^2}\overline{v^2}$$
    $$P = \frac{1}{3}\frac{Nm}{V}\overline{v^2}$$

    <p>Where $V$ is the volume of the container.</p>

    <p>This equation can also be written as:</p>
    $$P = \frac{1}{3}\frac{Nm}{V}v^2$$
    
    <p>Where $v$ is the root mean square (rms) speed:</p>
    $$v = \sqrt{\overline{v^2}}$$

    <p><strong>Relation to Density:</strong></p>
    <p>Since $Nm$ is the total mass and density $\rho = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}$, we can write:</p>
    $$P = \frac{1}{3}\rho v^2$$
    <p>Where $\rho$ is the density of gas (kg/m³)</p>
